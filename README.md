(a)    Construct the addition and multiplication tables   for   R/pR.    (Please   leave the   elements   in   the   order   given   above:   when   you   work   out   the   tables   you   will   see   they   are   given   in   that   order   for   a   reason!)

(e)      Show   that   the   element   2   + √-10 is   irreducible   but   not   prime   in   Z[√-10].    [Hint:    Show   it   divides   14   and that   there   are   no   elements   of   norm   2   or   7.]
7.   We   can   use   successive   squaring   and   the   same   order-calculation   procedure   we   used   in   Z/mZ   to   establish   the   order of an   arbitrary unit residue   class   s in   R/rR:   explicitly,   s   has   order   n   if   and   only   if   sn      =   1   and   sn/p      ≠      1   for   any   integer   prime p   dividing   n.

(d)      Find   the   orders   of   2,   x,   and   x   + 1   in   F5 [x]   modulo   x2    + 2.    Are   any   of   them   primitive   roots?    [Hint:    By
(c),   the   order   of each   element   divides   24,   so   search   among   divisors   of 24.]
